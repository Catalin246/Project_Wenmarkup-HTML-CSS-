            <p>
                At the side of the court by the service box, the Cyclops system was installed. Two boxes, each in line 
				with the service box line, were configured.
				Five infrared beams were sent from one of the Cyclops boxes to the receiving box across the court 
				(about 10 mm above the ground). Additionally, it was linked to a more compact control box that the service
				line umpire was holding. Naturally, there was a similar set up on the other side of the internet.
				Four infrared beams were located outside the service line, up to 45 cm away from the line, while one
				was located along the good side of the service box line.
				A successful ball strike will break the first beam and turn off the others when it is good (or just inside the
				line). One of the other four beams was broken if the serve was long.
				The control box indicated with a green light in the first scenario that the first line had been broken and the
				serve was successful. The ball signaled with a red light and a loud beep if it broke any of the other beams 
				but not the first one.
				When the system originally appeared, the beep that most of you will recall was really a whistle, but after
				the crowd began to imitate it, it was changed to a beeping sound since it was also thought that this would be
				easier to hear in a noisy stadium.
				Only close calls could be detected by the technology, thus serves that were far from the infrared beams were
				thought to be simple picks for umpires and line judges to judge only by eye.

				A recent remark inquired as to what the loud beeping sound associated with lengthy serves heard in the 
				1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s was.
				Cyclops, the first electronic line judging tool, was utilized for the first time at Wimbledon in 1980.
				Let's look at the technologies that made it possible for later tools like Hawkeye and the electronic net
				machine to be developed.

                <h1 class="titleInovation">Why Was Cyclops Only Used for Serves?</h1>
            </header>
            <p>
				Cyclops was only able to do serves because it was unsure of what was shattering the beam. In truth, although
				it was upgraded over time to be less sensitive to light and other objects, there were times when foreign 
				objects like insects and debris in the breeze created phantom beeps.
				Players, however, frequently step outside the lines with their feet and racquets on the baseline and the
				sidelines. Every time a beam was tripped, the system would sound.
				Cyclops had to be turned off right away after a strong serve (the umpire punched a button on the control box) 
				to prevent another ball, racket, or a player's foot by the service line from tripping the beams and sounding a beep.

            <p>
                The introduction of Cyclops heralded the advent of electronic aids to help officials in tennis, and as a result, 
				other systems always seem to hit the market that are more effective. Cyclops's 25-year run came to an end in 2005 
				with the launch of Hawkeye. The US Open replaced the French Open as the first major to use Hawk-Eye in 2005, 
				followed by the Australian Open in 2007 and Wimbledon in 2008. When the slams replaced the bow and arrow, it 
				was quickly replaced by a more accurate and all-encompassing tool. It was quickly discarded, and replaced with 
				the superior hawkeye. Despite no longer being in use at tennis tournaments, the technology that it pioneered has
				had a lasting impact on the sport.

                <h1 class="titleInovation">Short history of Cyclops system</h1>
            </header>
            <p>
                Cyclops was the original line monitor employed by tennis umpires. It was created in 1979 by 
				Bill Carlton, the inventor, and Margaret Parnis England. In 1980, Wimbledon immediately 
				embraced the technique, and it was afterwards utilized at the US Open and Australian Open. 
				Similar to Hawkeye, it was never utilized on clay because to the issues posed by the surface's 
				undulations and dust particles.
				The umpire would activate it before each service point, and it was only ever used to judge whether
				a serve was in or out. then turned off when the service was satisfactory.
				It was never a method that caused any controversy, even though no numbers were ever supplied to 
				demonstrate its effectiveness. In most cases, it was utilized to supplement the line judges rather
				than to replace them, and the line umpire made the final determination. If there were any doubts 
				about the system's accuracy or the dreaded "phantom beep," the system was sometimes turned off
				during a match.

            <p>
                The Hawk-Eye system is not one of the most affordable systems to adopt. The technology providers had 
				to set up a system that used radar and other elements to determine where a ball strikes accurately. 
				Despite some drawbacks, the features of the game remain highly useful to players and spectators today.
				The price of implementing Hawk-Eye will vary from court to court, since each one is different.
				Setting up a Hawk-Eye stadium can cost anywhere from $25,000 to $75,000.
