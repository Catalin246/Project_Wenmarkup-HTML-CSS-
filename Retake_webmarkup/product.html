                        The headset is the best technological advancement football has to offer, regardless 
						of whether coaches use it for communication or slam it against the ground. There are
						countless applications that are all beneficial. Coaches in the press box can observe 
						aerial views of the game, and using a headset, they can communicate information to the
						head coach who would not have that perspective from the ground. Another common headpiece
						interaction is between coaches and players on the sidelines. After all, the guy in the 
						box can undoubtedly see formations and trends that the quarterback cannot see from
						behind the center.

                        Do you believe John McEnroe would debate a computer as well? Due to their precise calls and absence 
						of disputes, these two electronic ball trackers have forever altered professional tennis. The Cyclops,
						a system of six infrared beams that hover barely a centimeter above the ground, was the first computerized 
						device to be discovered. All other beams outside the court would turn off if the ball was hit inside the
						court. A sound would project if the ball was struck just outside the court, stopping play. Simple as that.

                       What a literal lifesaver. Heart monitors are useful for everyone from the everyday runner to today's top athletes. 
					   If these gadgets are utilized to target a specific heart rate, they are extremely important for improving in a 
					   training regimen. Athletes would find it challenging to measure their progress and the viability of their exercise 
					   regimen without a cardiac monitor. Athletes can be warned of dehydration and malnutrition using some cardiac monitors.
					   The best piece of sports technology nowadays is a straightforward wristband or strap-on device that can alert users 
					   to a potentially hazardous exercise session or be a crucial component of every workout.
